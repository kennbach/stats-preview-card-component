## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility Aware

### What I learned

This project challenge me to use the grid area system to get the layout to satisfy the design requirements. I also tried a few different solutions for the image color overlay. I tried both a background color with a image with .5 opacity and then an image with a color overlay. In the end I chose the overlay, but neither matched the design exactly.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about all the mix-blend-modes that are available. Perhaps with better knowledge of them I could have matched the design perfectly.

- [Kevin Powell: Are you using the right CSS units?](https://youtu.be/N5wpD9Ov_To) - There are a lot of different units that we can use when writing CSS, in this video Kevin gives some general rules of thumb of which ones are best suited for which situations. This is also where I learned how to convert the root font-size to base-10.

- Both, [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) and [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja) have a virtual-ton of great web app development tutorials. I only listed a few above, but there are many, many more.
